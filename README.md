# PreSA: Prediction-Search Automator

PreSA is being developed as a small automation tool to bridge AF2 protein prediction and structural homology searches using FoldSeek or DALI. This tool is being developed specifically for the NJT group at The Sainsbury Laboratory (Norwich, UK) meaning it will not be designed to work outside of TSL HPC systems.
